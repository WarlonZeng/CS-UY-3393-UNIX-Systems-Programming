How to use:

Two files.

For servers: ./chat_server -u server -p 20000
For clients: ./chat_client -u client -i localhost -p 20000

This program is specifically designed for 2 person chat: one client, one server.
The client can disconnect at will by ctrl-c keyboard interrupt.
A new client can connect to the server. The server closes reading end and accepts new client with new fds.

Followed by per specs, server and client act alike and server can wait for another client. Server will sit there.
