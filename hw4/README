redirection to shell does not work properly after i/o redirection, i.e., ls > out.txt
tried closing fd, idk. contents are correct though.

cd updates PWD and OLDPWD accordingly, i.e., cd, ls > out.txt.
execvp throws error with redirection symbols, had to update args accordingly to exclude.

-- all fixed
