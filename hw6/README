How to use:
Two files.

For servers: ./chat_server -u server -p 20000
For clients: ./chat_client -u client -i localhost -p 20000

QUICK TEST:
./chat_server
./chat_client

3 terminals - 1 server, 2 clients.

SUPPORTS: 
concurrent clients
message queue
client queue
clients can see who is online
client can see who left and joined during session
help messages with -h command
defaults with no arguments on command line
locks for specific operations for shared resources
condition variable on consumer thread - producers are clients
thread exits
client CTRL + C server detection support (server interprets the same way as client typing 'exit')
bye message after typing 'exit'
lots of documenting
error detection
probably a few more
